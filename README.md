9.Possible Solution: 

   Based on the insights derived from the dashboard, the following recommendations are proposed to strengthen sales performance and customer engagement:

  - City-Level Focus:
    Prioritize marketing and promotional campaigns in top-performing cities to maximize revenue, while designing region-specific strategies for underperforming areas to capture untapped market potential.

  - Payment Strategy Optimization:
    Since UPI and card payments dominate customer preferences, optimize checkout processes around these methods. Introduce targeted incentives or cashback offers to encourage adoption of underutilized channels,      improving overall transaction efficiency.

  - Brand Performance Management:
    Strengthen partnerships and promotional investments with leading brands and models that drive the highest sales volume. At the same time, reposition mid- and low-performing brands with competitive pricing or     bundled offers to improve their market share.

  - Customer Experience Enhancement:
    Use customer rating insights to identify service gaps. Address low-rated transactions through improved after-sales support, warranty offers, and customer care initiatives to boost satisfaction and loyalty.

  - Seasonal and Weekly Campaign Planning:
    Leverage monthly and weekly sales trends to plan promotional campaigns during high-demand periods (festive seasons, weekends) and deploy targeted offers on low-performing days to balance revenue flow.

  - Inventory and Supply Chain Management:
    Ensure adequate stock availability of high-demand smartphone models, using predictive insights from monthly and model-level sales data. This will minimize stockouts, reduce delays, and increase customer          retention.
